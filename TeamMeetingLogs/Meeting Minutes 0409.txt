Meeting Minutes 04/09:
- use office hours (3-5 on Wednesdays) to prevent blocking in the future
- do smaller tasks when waiting for others and then integrate your feature with the others
- update release notes prior to meeting with TA
- make sure to make consistent commits (to feature branches) (must commit three times each week with relavent commit messages)

Individual Updates
Madison: working on delete reviews and navbar - push changes to feature branch and test those; push in smaller components to prevent losing changes and keep consistent commits

Don: finished the account page; not currently facing challenges because we now have data and waiting on delete

Maddie: working on writing a new review; created a page to write a new review; many of the options are dropdown menus to prevent wrong data; also working on route to actually add review to database

Matt: finished course suggestions being displayed (merged to main); worked on preliminary course page setup; working on directing to course page by clicking on a link

Dalton: finished login, registration, and logout; currently waiting on reviews before implementing upvote/downvote system

Plan:
- putting everything together
- finishing up navbar
- once reviews can be added, they will be displayed on the account page

Functional Code:
- login displays a message based on what data is entered
- initially directed to login page
- register button on login reroutes to the register page
- once you have registered it will redirect 
- course dropdown menu
- clicking on dropdown option redirects to course page
- account page is made
