# Rate My Courses
*Rate My Courses* is a platform where students can rate classes on various metrics such as difficulty, how well they’re taught, and workload. Along with these metrics, the platform will also allow users to write reviews of the class, allowing for a more detailed and unrestricted assessment. The primary value of our website will be filling the void left by FCQ’s: students may share their true opinion without being confined to the questions on the FCQ.
